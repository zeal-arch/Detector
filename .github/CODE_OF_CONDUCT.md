# Code of Conduct

## Don't Be a Jerk

Look, this is pretty simple. Be cool to each other. We're all here trying to build something useful.

## The Basics

**Do:**

- Be respectful - everyone was a beginner once
- Help others when you can
- Give constructive feedback, not just criticism
- Admit when you're wrong (we all make mistakes)
- Focus on the code, not the person

**Don't:**

- Be toxic or harass people
- Spam or troll
- Share people's personal info without permission
- Make it weird or uncomfortable for others
- Start drama over nothing

## If Someone's Being a Problem

If someone's being abusive or harassing people, open an issue or contact the maintainers. I'll look into it and handle it appropriately. Might be a warning, might be removing comments, might be banning if it's serious.

## That's It

Honestly, just use common sense. If you wouldn't want someone doing it to you, don't do it to others. We're all just trying to download videos here.
