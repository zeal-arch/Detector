## What's wrong?

Describe what's broken. Don't worry about being technical - just tell me what happened like you're explaining it to a friend.

## How do I make it happen again?

1. I was on [website name]...
2. I clicked on...
3. And then it did [the broken thing]...

## What did you expect to happen?

What were you hoping would happen instead?

## Where were you when it broke?

- **Website**: Which site? (Drop the link if you want)
- **Browser**: Chrome? Firefox? Something else?
- **Your computer**: Windows? Mac? Linux? Your phone?

(Also if you're using an adblocker or VPN, mention that - sometimes they mess things up)

## Can you show me?

Screenshots or screen recordings are super helpful! You can just drag and drop them here.

Don't know how to take a screenshot?

- **Windows**: Press `Win + Shift + S` and select an area
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + 4` and select an area
- **Just take a phone pic** of your screen if that's easier honestly

## Anything else?

Anything else you think might help me figure this out?
